# logging-ini-generator
Generates a list of logging categories from a given Qt project.

This was created as a first step for a hackathon project:

https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-18177

It can be built and used as an external tool in Qt Creator, but the plan is to add a Logging plugin that allows the categories to be visually enabled and disabled via the Run Settings page:
